3717,"I can remember many happy events of my life and out of those, I would like to talk about the event that I can still remember vividly regarding my success in the board exam. The moment I heard that I had been awarded a scholarship based on my performance in the board exam, I became the happiest man in the world. This was indeed a very happy moment for me as it is something I was looking forward to achieving and the news made my parents quite happy and proud.I spent almost a month with great anxiety regarding my result publication. I started speculating so many things and many of them were negative. I could hardly keep away the tensions about my upcoming result. The result was so important that my college admission would mostly depend on it. I could not sleep well in the night before the result publishing. I think this is a common anxiety for students and I was familiar with this type of anxiety. However, this particular exam results game me more nightmares than any other time of my life.","3m","33","IND","f","half_a_day","married","y"
3718,"Describe a happy event of your life"" is an example of cue card topic that gives a candidate a wide range of options to pick from. You are virtually free to talk about any event that you think you would be flexible to talk about. On the contrary, the topic like ""Describe a famous writer in your country"" narrows your option. You can't just pick any writer and start talking about him. For the later topic, you need to think about such a writer and give some factual information about him.The cue cards that give you wide options are usually easier to talk about since you won't have to wonder a lot to pick what you would talk about. For this cue card i.e. ""Describe a happy event of your life"" think about an event in your life that made you happy. If you take it from your life rather than making it up, you would be able to give more details and extend the topic.","3m","33","IND","f","half_a_day","married","y"
3719,"The problem: A common answer to this question is to compliment the company by saying something like, XYZ is the leading creator of innovative solutions, and I want to work for a market leader, says Matt Doucette, director of global talent acquisition for the job website Monster.com. A more honest answer, he adds, might be, You were the only ones who read my resume, so of course I want to work for you. I need a job.What you should say: A good answer, however, revolves around the mission, vision, and values of the company. If they are a match for your goals and desires, then talk about that, he says. Talk about being connected to the values of the company. Talk about how the mission speaks to you, and then tie those things back to the description and your unique skill set.","3m","33","IND","f","a_few_minutes","married","y"

3866,"In one set of studies, depressed participants were invited to take a few minutes once a day to relish something that they usually hurry through (e.g., eating a meal, taking a shower, finishing the workday, or walking to the subway). When it was over, they were instructed to write down in what ways they had experienced the event differently as well as how that felt compared with the times when they rushed through it. In another study, healthy students and community members were instructed to savor two pleasurable experiences per day, by reflecting on each for two or three minutes and trying to make the pleasure last as long and as intensely as possible. In all these studies those participants prompted to practice savoring regularly showed significant increases in happiness and reductions in depression.","3m","30","AGO","m","half_a_day","married","y"

4794,"I was on the 25 Treasure Island on Treasure Island . Two tourists that didn't speak/understand English well wanted to get to the part of the Bay Bridge where there's a walking/biking path (the East Span from Yerba Buena Island to Oakland). The 25 goes only on the West Span (Treasure Island/SF), doesn't have a stop on Yerba Buena Island, and Treasure Island is under construction so the bus stops can be confusing. They tried asked a couple of different people on the bus but they weren't able to help or didn't want to help. Luckily, for the tourists a guy stepped up and helped them. He explained to them how they needed to get off the last stop on the island and where they have to walk to get to Yerba Buena. When the bus approached the last stop and it was apparent that the tourists were still confused, he got off the bus with them. (At that time of day, the 25 is scheduled to run is every 20 minutes but it's often delayed. The 25 is also the only public transportation option between Treasure Island and SF.)Living in a city that has a high population of visible homelessness, it's easy to get jaded. Brushing people off is normal. It was heartwarming to see someone help others out. He didn't have to get off the bus with them. I'd like to think that when those tourists go back home they'll tell their family and friends about the nice guy instead of the all the people begging and sleeping on the streets.","3m","30","USA","f","all_day_im_still_feeling_it","single","n"

7023,"Make your own happiness a priority.Your happiness matters. We tend to put other people's happiness before our own and make excuses for the reasons why we neglect our needs - we are too busy, too skint, too stressed out. If you don't value your own happiness then no one else will. It is entirely possible to look out for your own needs and still care about your friends and family. If you are happy, you are more likely to spread happiness and care for those around you.Think about what makes you happy. Now what would make me delirious would be to wake late, eat cake, drink wine and spend the day sunbathing somewhere on a hot and beautiful beach. That's not realistic at this point in my life as I think my kids would have something to say about it!But what does make me happy is writing, fresh linen, watching a good film, open fires, sauvignon blanc, walking in the woods with the dog, my chickens, a good meal with awesome friends, a lie in with my husband, dancing...There are a LOT of things that make me happy that cost little or nothing and those things I make time for. It's easy to neglect your own desires but so important that you don't.2. Spend time with people who make you happyWho are the people that you enjoy spending time with? Who makes you happy, who loves, respects and appreciates you and who makes you want to be a better person? If you surround yourself with negative people then your life will be filled with negativity, and the opposite is true also, being around positive, happy people make you aspire to be positive and happy.Sometimes we can't help whom we have to spend time with, we may have work colleagues or family members who are Debbie Downers and we have to hang out with them at times. But in our social lives it is so important to keep awesome and positive people around us, the ones who make us laugh, who are joyous to be around. Some of the people who make me happy are filthy minded, raucous and quite dark! But they are interesting and make me feel good about myself.3. Take responsibility for your own lifeThis is a biggy for me, the trait I hate the most in people is refusing to take responsibility for their own lives. People who have constant excuses for their bad behaviour, who think it is always someone or something else's fault. People who say ""its alright for you because...""Own your life. Own your mistakes. Live, learn and move on. The world doesn't owe you anything; you make your own path through this world. Everyone faces hardships throughout their life and you can choose to be a martyr to your tough times or own the shit out of them and move forward as a stronger person.4. Be yourself. Everyone else is takenBe the best version of yourself that you can be. Be true to yourself and be proud of the person you are. It's easy to compare ourselves to others, and the fact is, there will always be someone thinner, smarter and prettier - but honestly, who cares?Whatever part of yourself you admire the most, be *that* more. The parts you dislike about yourself, be *that* less. Be proud of your quirks and weirdness, stand tall and proud and applaud your inner awesomeness!5. Create your own happinessNo one can change your life and make you truly happy except you. Choose positivity over negativity and smile because you can. Choose to be happy with who you are right now and allow your joy to shape your present and your future. Do the things that make you happy more often, spend time with those who bring out your smile and create your own happiness.If you are waiting for someone else to make you happy, you may be waiting a long time.6. Find the silver liningWhen you are going through a tough time it is easy to slip into feeling defeated and that life is just too hard. We go through things in life that we think will break us. Illness, bereavement, job loss, money troubles, and it can feel like there is no way to get through these times. The truth is we are stronger than we think.It is important to look for the silver lining even if that is only the tiniest sliver of hope. If there is no silver lining in your situation, for example the death of a loved one, then try to count your blessings and be grateful of the good things in your life.When things are hard, and you feel down, take a few deep breaths and remind yourself that you can and will grow stronger from these hard times. Remain conscious of your blessings and victories, of all the things in your life that are right. Focus on what you have, not on what you havent.7. Be kindBe a kind person, one who is caring and thoughtful, who thinks of others and treats people with respect. Kindness breeds kindness. Its a simple one but so important.8. Be openBe open; share your thoughts and feelings with the people closest to you. If you are hurting then accept the hurt and allow yourself time to heal, let your loved ones in and be honest with them. A problem shared is a problem halved, the act of speaking your troubles out loud can be of as much help as any advice you may receive. Becoming a more open person can lead to real happiness.9. Let go of the pastOur pasts define who we are and we can learn lessons from the things we have gone through, but when your past is keeping you from moving forward it becomes a problem. We have all had tough experiences but if you are reliving the pain of this experience again and again and it is affecting your present then it is time to let go.Letting go doesn't mean forgetting what has happened or pretending it didn't happen, it means letting go of the pain and resentment that is holding you back. This is easier in some situations than others, but be honest with yourself and if something from your past is affecting your present then it may be time to talk through those issues either with a trusted friend or family member or a trained therapist.10. Take a chanceTwo years ago my husband and I took a leap of faith, we sold our home and rented a 15th century mill to push our photography business forward. It was a risk, but a calculated risk. I knew that if there was a motto to live by (other than 'If you can't sing well, sing LOUD') it was 'I'd rather regret the things I did, than the things I didn't do.' We plotted and planned, did the sums a million times and then decided to take a chance. And it was the best thing we ever did, don't get me wrong there have been some very tough times but I knew we had made the right decision.Life is not about getting a chance; it is about taking a chance. If there is something you have always dreamed of doing, then try to make it happen. If it works you will have achieved a goal, if it doesn't you know you at least tried it and you WILL learn a lesson from it.11. Be mindfulLive in the present, in the here and now. It is so easy to let busy lives, technology and procrastination take over our lives, but being mindful of the things around you can bring peace and happiness into your life. Take time to notice the things that are important in your life right now, experience life as it happens. Don't dwell on the past or imagine how great things could be in the future. This moment is the only thing guaranteed to you in life, we never know what the future holds so enjoy today.12. Concentrate on the things you can control, not the things you can'tWorry and stress is a normal part of life but when your day is taken up with worrying about the things in life you cannot control it is a sign that things need to change. Worrying about things that are beyond your control is such a waste of your time and emotional energy.Worry affects you, not the person or situation you are worrying about. If it is important to you and you can control the outcome and positively help a problem then great, if not then let it go. You have enough genuine problems to face in life without upsetting yourself with things beyond your control.13. Face your problems and make a positive changeThere's no point in burying your head in the sand, if you have a problem, you need to face it head on and make a positive change as no one is going to do it for you. The problem will not just disappear on it's own without action from you and no problem is too big to overcome. It takes acceptance from you and then a plan, no matter how small the steps, you need to do little and often and move it forward.Some problems you will be able to overcome alone with a good old-fashioned list and a bit of hard work. Others are bigger and need support from others. There is no shame in asking for help, whether it is the help of friends, family or a professional.14. Appreciate the things you havePerspective. There will always be someone better off than you and someone worse off than you. Learn to appreciate the things you have, rather than worrying about the things you don't. I'm not saying we shouldn't aspire to be greater than we are now, but don't be so busy in thinking of the things that you don't have that you forget to appreciate all you do.15. Love those around youAppreciate and love those around you, bring joy to the people who mean the most by telling them how much they mean to you. Since my sister moved to Australia I end all our conversations with ""love you"" I didn't do this before she left but her moving half way around the world brought out something in me that makes me want her to know how much she means to me.This isn't about huge grand gestures, it is about personal, meaningful acts that let your friends and family know how awesome they are. A text message, sending a photo that you think they'll find funny, a hug, a few words.","24h","43","IND","m","all_day_im_still_feeling_it","married","y"

Naturally, I jumped at the offer.The first day, I walked into the building and got myself introduced at the reception. She was an old Malay lady who seemed very friendly and helped me get through the door.Everyday my walk in and out of the office, she had to man the door and I was a little embarrassed to ask her every time I pass. She, however seemed not to mind my interruption in her daily routine. Today was my last day at this office and while I was coming back from my evening walk, I got the Security lady a juice along with my usual fruit snack. I thought I'd thank her for being patient enough to bear me this whole week.Though it wasn't a huge gesture she received it with so much humility and thanked me profusely for thinking about her.Her happy face made my evening a lot brighter. I think we all need a little appreciation/encouragement to lead this sometimes monotonous life.","24h","27","USA","m","all_day_im_still_feeling_it","single","n"

8770,"""Describe a happy event of your life"" is an example of cue card topic that gives a candidate a wide range of options to pick from. You are virtually free to talk about any event that you think you would be flexible to talk about. On the contrary, the topic like ""Describe a famous writer in your country"" narrows your option. You can't just pick any writer and start talking about him. For the later topic, you need to think about such a writer and give some factual information about him.The cue cards that give you wide options are usually easier to talk about since you won't have to wonder a lot to pick what you would talk about. For this cue card i.e. ""Describe a happy event of your life"" think about an event in your life that made you happy. If you take it from your life rather than making it up, you would be able to give more details and extend the topic.","24h","31","USA","m","half_a_day","married","y"

11532,"""Describe a happy event of your life"" is an example of cue card topic that gives a candidate a wide range of options to pick from. You are virtually free to talk about any event that you think you would be flexible to talk about. On the contrary, the topic like ""Describe a famous writer in your country"" narrows your option. You can't just pick any writer and start talking about him. For the later topic, you need to think about such a writer and give some factual information about him.The cue cards that give you wide options are usually easier to talk about since you won't have to wonder a lot to pick what you would talk about. For this cue card i.e. ""Describe a happy event of your life"" think about an event in your life that made you happy. If you take it from your life rather than making it up, you would be able to give more details and extend the topic.Following are some of the ideas you can take as examples of happy events of your life but always try to speak about a real event of your life.1. Your father got promoted and your family celebrated it.2. You got admitted to a school/ college/ university where you dreamed of studying.3. The birth of your younger sister/ brother/ nephew/ niece or even your own kid if you are a father/ mother.4. One of your family members was severely ill but got healed miraculously.5. You won a competition.6. You did something for others and people acclaimed that.7. You got a scholarship.8. You overcame one of your obstacles.9. You went to visit a foreign country10. You achieved something noteworthy.11. You saved someone from a big problem. Cue Card Answer 2:In my face, I feel a glow whenever I remember the day I went to the International trade fair with some of my friends. That was my first International trade fair visit and this was such a happy experience that I still feel a great joy reciting the memory of this event. It was January 1998 and that time I was in my first year of college.Until I finished my college, I was kind of a newborn lady, who had never visited any places without her places of her local area. After I got admitted into the college, I started exploring the world and the amazing things that invite people like us. One day I planned with my friends that we would visit International trade fair. This might seem like a very usual and banal event for others but to me, that was a really exciting thing to do. Later on, we did as we thought and finalised our visit to the fair. After break period at college, we escaped by the back door (As a side note, I would like to mention that Id no previous record of escaping school or college before). We were five in members and we hired a taxi to reach the trade fair. There wasnt enough space to sit on the back side of the taxi and the taxi driver gave a suspicious look at us. Thats why with a fishy smile we took the decision that one of us would sit in front of the baby taxi with the taxi driver. It was a funny decision but there was no alternative to us and we enjoyed it. After few minutes we reached the fair and then collected the tickets. We were thoroughly enjoying everything we did that time. We entered the fair and took a deep breath to ease ourselves.

11533,"Cue Card Answer 2:In my face, I feel a glow whenever I remember the day I went to the International trade fair with some of my friends. That was my first International trade fair visit and this was such a happy experience that I still feel a great joy reciting the memory of this event. It was January 1998 and that time I was in my first year of college.Until I finished my college, I was kind of a newborn lady, who had never visited any places without her places of her local area. After I got admitted into the college, I started exploring the world and the amazing things that invite people like us. One day I planned with my friends that we would visit International trade fair. This might seem like a very usual and banal event for others but to me, that was a really exciting thing to do. Later on, we did as we thought and finalised our visit to the fair. After break period at college, we escaped by the back door (As a side note, I would like to mention that Id no previous record of escaping school or college before). We were five in members and we hired a taxi to reach the trade fair. There wasnt enough space to sit on the back side of the taxi and the taxi driver gave a suspicious look at us. Thats why with a fishy smile we took the decision that one of us would sit in front of the baby taxi with the taxi driver. It was a funny decision but there was no alternative to us and we enjoyed it. After few minutes we reached the fair and then collected the tickets. We were thoroughly enjoying everything we did that time. We entered the fair and took a deep breath to ease ourselves. We were kind of overwhelmed to observe the vast area with hundreds of shops and stalls. People were all around us and we felt like somehow we have come to a fairy land. Wherever we went, I was feeling so excited, everything was totally new to me as a grown-up lady. We took lots of photos from different views, purchased few interesting things within our limited budget and roamed in the whole area of the fair. I forgot my usual area, boundaries and the same thing I do almost every day and felt a happiness that I missed for a long. We spent almost 4-5 hours in the trade fair and at last returned to our home in the evening.

11534,"Q. What do you think is important in achieving happiness?Answer: I strongly believe that ordinary yet priceless things such as health, family solidarity and closeness, important people like friends who will always be there for you no matter what and job satisfaction can definitely lead to happiness. I am opposed to the belief that money makes everyone happy and replete. Although money and wealth are essential elements for human life as they help people cover their expenses, do things they want and purchase materials people want, I don't think that they are the determinant factors. Furthermore, self-contentment could be another important ingredient for us to be happy. We can be happy with however little we have only if we have the self-satisfaction and self-contentment.Q. How do you celebrate some happy events?Answer: As I can remember, when I was younger I used to held parties at my home solely with my family and relatives. Especially on my birthdays, my mom cooked my favourite foods and made my favourite birthday cake with chocolate. Now that I am not a teenager anymore, I go out with my friends and in some special circumstances with my family as well. For example, on my graduation day, I went to a Greek restaurant with my parents, brother and my five best friends and we had a really great time. Generally speaking, I would say that I am more of an introvert person, so I totally prefer to spend substantial time with few friends rather than having many people and typical relationships. My happy moments and celebrations are also related to my friends and family members. Q. What role the camera and video play in celebrating?Answer: I would argue that these two tools, camera and video, play an integral part in different types of celebrations. First of all, most people have moments of their childhood and memories from childhood are captured in cameras. To illustrate, some of the most important events such as birthday parties, weddings, graduations and so on are included in these jigs and in this way the moment is captured and saved for a long period of time. Furthermore, as some essential and happy events are recorded, they could be used and displayed years later in order for some people to remember some significant events. A good illustration in my case is that on my 22nd birthday, my friends made me a really emotional video from all the years that we have been friends. Without the usage of the camera and video-recorder, this could never have happened.[Part-three question answers are written by Mary, UK] If you can talk about this cue card, you should be able to answer the following cue cards as well:1.

The moment I heard that I had been awarded a scholarship based on my performance in the board exam, I became the happiest man in the world. This was indeed a very happy moment for me as it is something I was looking forward to achieving and the news made my parents quite happy and proud.I spent almost a month with great anxiety regarding my result publication. I started speculating so many things and many of them were negative. I could hardly keep away the tensions about my upcoming result. The result was so important that my college admission would mostly depend on it. I could not sleep well in the night before the result publishing. I think this is a common anxiety for students and I was familiar with this type of anxiety. However, this particular exam results game me more nightmares than any other time of my life.The result was published at around 11.00 am and I found that I did exceptionally well. I was so relieved and happy that I literally shouted. Then I hurriedly came back to our home and gave the news to my parents. They were happy too. My father bought sweets and my mother gave it to our neighbours. I felt excited, happy and relieved. At that time I was about 15 years old.

12370,"There's an easy-to-articulate, hard-to-implement best practice when it comes to how to teach yourself to be happy. It stems from the recognition that the positive things you do for other people often reverberate back to create positivity in your own life. In effect, doing little things to make other people happy can greatly improve your happiness.Make sense? There are two theories at work. The first is that focusing on others creates joy of its own accord. The second is that as you succeed in improving others' happiness, you'll wind up with happier, more grateful people around you. They'll find you likable and charismatic, which in turn can lead them to treat you in a manner that produces even more happiness.It's easier said than done, but fortunately, there's a compelling shortcut. Your words are among your greatest tools, so you can have an outsize effect on others simply by thinking about what you say every day and making an effort to be both positive and sincere. There are certain inspiring things that truly happy people find themselves saying to others all the time. Try making an effort to say a few of these every day for a week. You'll be amazed at how the positivity you create improves your happiness.","24h","27","USA","f","a_few_minutes","single","n"

Joel will share his ideas and insights about lifehacking, building a business and working on company culture. Here is #1:Today its a little over three years since I first had the idea for Buffer, and with the year and a half before that which I worked on my previous startup, Ive started to notice a few patterns amongst the ups and downs that come with building a startup.One of the most important things Ive learned during this time is that I perform the best when Im happy. It really does change everything. If Im happy then Im more productive when hacking code, Im better at answering support, and I find it easier to stay focused.Ive found that there are a few key habits which, for me, act as great rituals for enabling me to be consistently happy. They also act as anchor activities to bring my happiness level back up quickly whenever I have a period where Im not feeling 100%.

12644,"As a nurse, I frequently bump into present and past patients in our local Walmart. Yesterday was no exception.  As I shopped I bumped into one of my favorite patients (his name is Roger) along with his son (Donny).  This gentlemen is in his 80's and has quite the comic personality.  He always wears silly hats that say something obnoxious on them.  He's always telling jokes.  Three years ago he had double bypass surgery and a subsequent stroke during recovery.  Everyone including the doctors believed he would not make it.  I went up to the ICU 45 minutes away and sat with his son for hours over the next few days.  I brought him a gift for Christmas which was a highly obnoxious dancing Christmas tree that I knew he would love.  After a few days and lots of prayers, Roger woke up miraculously!!!!  The first thing he did was tell a joke.  This family holds a special place in my heart due to their love for life even after suffering incredible losses.  Roger has suffered through the loss of his wife from cancer and his first born son from a very rare and lethal disease.  His son Donny who takes care of Roger, also suffers from the same rare disease his brother died from.  These two are wonderful people and truly an example of how not to let life let you down!","24h","47","USA","f","all_day_im_still_feeling_it","married","y"

12736,"In my face, I feel a glow whenever I remember the day I went to the International trade fair with some of my friends. That was my first International trade fair visit and this was such a happy experience that I still feel a great joy reciting the memory of this event. It was January 1998 and that time I was in my first year of college.Until I finished my college, I was kind of a newborn lady, who had never visited any places without her places of her local area. After I got admitted into the college, I started exploring the world and the amazing things that invite people like us. One day I planned with my friends that we would visit International trade fair. This might seem like a very usual and banal event for others but to me, that was a really exciting thing to do. Later on, we did as we thought and finalised our visit to the fair. After break period at college, we escaped by the back door (As a side note, I would like to mention that Id no previous record of escaping school or college before). We were five in members and we hired a taxi to reach the trade fair. There wasnt enough space to sit on the back side of the taxi and the taxi driver gave a suspicious look at us. Thats why with a fishy smile we took the decision that one of us would sit in front of the baby taxi with the taxi driver. It was a funny decision but there was no alternative to us and we enjoyed it.","24h","30","USA","m","half_a_day","married","y"
12737,"I would argue that these two tools, camera and video, play an integral part in different types of celebrations. First of all, most people have moments of their childhood and memories from childhood are captured in cameras. To illustrate, some of the most important events such as birthday parties, weddings, graduations and so on are included in these jigs and in this way the moment is captured and saved for a long period of time. Furthermore, as some essential and happy events are recorded, they could be used and displayed years later in order for some people to remember some significant events. A good illustration in my case is that on my 22nd birthday, my friends made me a really emotional video from all the years that we have been friends. Without the usage of the camera and video-recorder, this could never have happened.","24h","30","USA","m","all_day_im_still_feeling_it","married","y"

13131,"Today, I am a completely different person. In my mind, people constantly evolve. We learn new things and meet new people, and we continue to change. For some, change is scary or un-welcomed. But for me, I love change. I love looking back and seeing how much I've grown. It's really important to me to keep learning new things, adding things to my life, and all in all, move forward. This has all led up to me becoming the strongest and happiest I've ever been...and here's why.","24h","28","IND","m","all_day_im_still_feeling_it","single","n"
13132,"For starters, I have a positive mentality. Old me always dreaded everything that came my way, and if anything good happened, I started preparing for another storm.

Now I know you can't just avoid every piece of conflict that comes headed your way, but I firmly believe that the people you surround yourself with are a reflection of who you are. They can easily rub off on you at any given time. So for me, it's very important that at any time a negative energy enters my life, that I take them out. It's very easy for me to be influenced by negativity, and I don't want to go back to that. Being able to weed out the bad seeds has become one of the best things I've ever learned.","24h","28","IND","m","all_day_im_still_feeling_it","single","n"

13141,"Every night before you go to bed write three good things that happened to you that day. Jotting those down is pretty much all it takes to get a boost in well-being over time.Theres a second lesson here: the reverse is also true. Keeping track of the bad things will make you miserable. A convenient memory is a powerful thing. Do not train your brain to see the negative, teach it to see the positive.","24h","26","USA","m","all_day_im_still_feeling_it","married","y"
13142,"One group was told to focus on all the upbeat things they could find sunshine, flowers, smiling pedestrians. Another was to look for negative stuff graffiti, litter, frowning faces. The third group was instructed to walk just for the exercise. At the end of the week, when the walkers well-being was tested again, those who had deliberately targeted positive cues were happier than before the experiment. The negatively focused subjects were less happy, and the just plain exercisers scored in between. The point, says Bryant, is that you see what you look for. And you can train yourself to attend to the joy out there waiting to be had, instead of passively waiting for it to come to you.","24h","26","USA","m","half_a_day","married","y"

We were five in members and we hired a taxi to reach the trade fair. There wasnt enough space to sit on the back side of the taxi and the taxi driver gave a suspicious look at us.

It was a funny decision but there was no alternative to us and we enjoyed it.","24h","33","IND","f","select one","married","y"

It is the natural craving for emotional security that impels young men and women toward marriage. Many a single person would prefer to avoid the obligations and responsibilities implied in marriage were it not for a realization of the need of emotional security that comes from being able to confide in a husband or a wife and expect this partner to be partial and unprejudiced, as he or she shares the problems and anxieties of the moment. The competitions of life are too strong and the jealousies too caustic to make it feasible or desirable to face life alone. Marriage provides a complementary self which serves as an emotional counter-balance.","24h","27","USA","m","at_least_one_hour","single","n"

18329,"n my face, I feel a glow whenever I remember the day I went to the International trade fair with some of my friends. That was my first International trade fair visit and this was such a happy experience that I still feel a great joy reciting the memory of this event. It was January 1998 and that time I was in my first year of college.Until I finished my college, I was kind of a newborn lady, who had never visited any places without her places of her local area. After I got admitted into the college, I started exploring the world and the amazing things that invite people like us. One day I planned with my friends that we would visit International trade fair. This might seem like a very usual and banal event for others but to me, that was a really exciting thing to do. Later on, we did as we thought and finalised our visit to the fair. After break period at college, we escaped by the back door (As a side note, I would like to mention that Id no previous record of escaping school or college before). We were five in members and we hired a taxi to reach the trade fair. There wasnt enough space to sit on the back side of the taxi and the taxi driver gave a suspicious look at us. Thats why with a fishy smile we took the decision that one of us would sit in front of the baby taxi with the taxi driver. It was a funny decision but there was no alternative to us and we enjoyed it.","3m","27","USA","m","all_day_im_still_feeling_it","married","y"

Doing tasks that have meaning for meLets say your current job is just a means to pay your rent and youre waiting for a dream job opportunity. But, whatever youre doing you want to be appreciated for your work. And how can we judge a fish by its climbing skills? We cant.3. Constructive feedbackThe most important part of your work is feedback. No matter if its positive or negative (and then you will know what you have to change) feedback represents a very important instrument for measuring the quality of your work. Constructive feedback that gives you ideas for improvement can transform your day into a very productive and cheerful one.","3m","29","IND","m","a_few_minutes","married","y"

Smiling co-workersA smile never cost anybody anything and a day seems to go better when you are surrounded by colleagues that smile and are willing to help you anytime or just to hug you when you are not feeling ok.5. Having a mentorNot anybody can brag about having a mentor at their job. A mentor is not only a teacher, it is the person that inspires you, the person from whom you want steal job know-how or hard-earned wisdom.6. A good training programWe all feel very motivated do our job the best way we can when we have a good training program. You can receive better feedback, you can be more focused on your work and you can improve your skills when you know youll be rewarded.7. Brainstorming sessionsBrainstorming sessions where we challenge our brains to come up with a mountain of ideas underneath which lies a single brilliant idea for a project are both relaxing and exhausting. Even though it seems like a paradox, a brainstorming session can actually summon all the creativity that we are capable of.8. Open-minded people aroundIf all the people around us would be open minded we would all have something to gain.9. A unique benefits packageWe bet you love free coffee or lunch, or free stuff included in your unique benefits package. Or maybe you prefer free gym or free parking. More and more employers are choosing to provide a coffee service in their office, gym memberships or stipends, lunches, or other benefits.","3m","29","IND","m","a_few_minutes","married","y"

A room designed exclusively for funWouldnt your work environment be happier if you would have a room only for entertainment purposes? A room full of games where you can leave the stress behind?3. Short breaksShort going-out-for-some-air breaks give you the perfect time to have a moment for yourself in which you can analyze your daily problems.4. A clean desktop with a nice wallpaperIn order to be productive, we need to be organized. The same applies to your desk, your files and, of course, your desktop.

20502,"Rumination, the habit of repeatedly chewing sad experiences or conversations, is like getting stuck in the sand. You dont make any progress. Your whole life gets stuck.Im not saying we rehash sad memories on purpose. I do that too. It took me time to realize that ruminating is an ineffective coping behavior. I started to practice how to delete sad memories. Forgetting a bad experience is truly liberating.Then, why do most people love rehashing memories?We expect a different outcome. By reliving over and over a story, we tend to believe that things are going to change. Unfortunately, no matter how many storylines you create in your mind, what happened wont change. What you can change is how you feel about it.so i have it happy event 3 months","3m","28","ASM","f","half_a_day","married","n"

20504,"From ancient scriptures to the latest science, gratitude is known to be good for us and those around us. Yet it isn't always our automatic response and we often take the good things in our lives for granted. So we have to consciously learn to get into the habit of being grateful.Science is showing that gratitude is important for how good we feel psychologically and socially. It increases how much positive emotion we feel and decreases negative emotion. It raises our overall satisfaction with life and helps us have an overall positive outlook. It has also been shown to reduce health complaints and help us cope with difficulties. It even seems to reduce the importance we place on material goods. And contrary to what we may think, it also appears that it could increase our ability to achieve our goals.so i have happy moment in last 3 months.","3m","28","ASM","f","at_least_one_hour","married","n"

I started speculating so many things and many of them were negative. I could hardly keep away the tensions about my upcoming result. The result was so important that my college admission would mostly depend on it. I could not sleep well in the night before the result publishing. I think this is a common anxiety for students and I was familiar with this type of anxiety. However, this particular exam results game me more nightmares than any other time of my life.The result was published at around 11.00 am and I found that I did exceptionally well. I was so relieved and happy that I literally shouted. Then I hurriedly came back to our home and gave the news to my parents. They were happy too.

It was really the back roads, two lanes, farms and trees.  However there wasn't any traffic!  During this the air conditioner conked out again, and we rolled down our windows.  This time it was lovely because it was cooler, the air was cleaner and we were able to drive (instead of stop-and-go) through the rolling hills.

Thankfully it was not. The whole day was a mess, but we were numbed by the new face my uncle introduced. His new girlfriend. She had a lot of interesting things to say and she enjoyed our company. I also got to play with my uncle's Nintendo Switch. I'm too poor to have new game cartridges, so I was having a blast.As the sun set, we all gathered outside and watched the fireworks. The last time I had seen fireworks that close was when I was less than ten years old. And the whole evening was rooted with nostalgia.

For Event, we design pumpkin kind of dressing or any special look, like a devil, angel dressing, vegetables and fruits cutting dress designs, cartoon dressing etc., and many more especially for kids. I design for my kid every Event year.I saw a kid wearing a Event dress with front and back of a dress body in a celebration get together. The dress was designed as the front part of the body says about a human being life with happiness, sorrow, angry, fear, anxiety, enthusiastic, arrogant, depressed etc., and back part of the body is all about vegetables & fruits that a human needs to follow frequently.I do still remember the kid. I was impressed with the dress design as it was an awesome thought of a designing a dress with a combination of vegetables & fruits and about a human being life. The dress on the front part is an wonderful thought, a message to people about how a human life carries wishes, pains, struggles, how we need to face them, what happens when we get angry. Each part of a life again comes with icons along with description like happiness has one icon, sorrow, angry, enthusiastic. The boy even behaves similar to the body stated on the whole day of Event, looks like how dedication they have towards to the festival and their hard work. The dress on the back part was like head designed with apple & pomegranate makeup, nose as a small grape, eyes with black colored makeup, ears like straw berries hanging, shoulders with papaya, hands with snake guard, fingers with lady fingers and in the middle of the body it appears like leafs pasted around the body, the legs with cucumber designed.etc.,","3m","32","IND","f","half_a_day","married","y"

What we have individualized social rules for male and female? and many more. These are all a kind of course about knowledge crisis towards life.

21236,"My journey to Ooty started in Madikeri. I did not bother checking the distance nor the time of the ride between the two cities, i just knew that Ooty is somewhere to the south, i went to the bus station and caught a bus (a spontaneous start for that Ooty travel experience).The bus ride started and i was enjoying the scenery of the Kodagu district (more on that area in the Madikeri post), at some point i felt that we were going east, and not south as expected. The local guy who was sitting near me asked me what was wrong, i told him my thoughts, and he confirmed, the bus actually was on its way to Mysore (Eastern part of Karnataka state). The guy told me that the final stop of the bus was Ooty (good news), the bad news were that Mysore is in a completely opposite direction, which meant that my bus ride was going to be longer than i though it would be. I did not care much, I still had around 9 months of travel time left, so I made myself comfortable on the seat, smiled and got into a conversation with my bus ride mate.The bus ride was really long, a one and a half hours stop in Mysore, few more hours on the road, a stop on the entrance to Bandipur wildlife sanctuary from 2AM-6AM and..The UltimOoty:I arrived to the Queen of the hill stations at about 10AM, which summed up a total of sixteen hours bus ride and the official beginning of my Ooty travel experience. The Ooty central bus station is close to the cheap accommodation area called the Bazaar Road, even the budget guesthouses are still a little more expensive in Ooty if compared to other parts of India. Expect to pay at least 400INR for a double room. I wanted some luxury, so i got a room in Hotel Manek for 600INR, which included a big double bed, T.V with many channels and hot water buckets for shower at any time of day","3m","32","IND","m","half_a_day","married","y"

21840,"For purposes of this HIT, the specific moment is:   I woke up in Loreto, Mexico and a friend opened the curtain early in the morning to reveal the sunrise.    Additional details on the totality of experience are as follows (optional):I took a trip to Loreto, Mexico in early May with friends and found it enjoyable for a number of reasons.  Perhaps one of the most enjoyable components was that the trip was mostly schedule and commitment free.  There was no where to be and very few expectations.  There was room for predictable and anticipated events and time and flexibility for unexpected ones.  Some of the more memorable moments were sharing meals with friends at a taco place that was slow and had no climate control (open windows).  The food was amazing and merely watching the workers (who appeared to be father and son and were likely the owners) was in of itself enjoyable and comforting.  The fish tacos were amazing and the fish to make them likely caught locally and recently; the lime juice squeezed moments before.  Speaking of comfort, happiness was experienced at the hotel where there was an incredible sunrise available from the comfort of one's bed.  The colors of orange over the Sea of Cortez / Gulf of California  (which was incredibly calm and free of visible waves) were vibrant and slowly changing as the sun took it's place higher in the morning sky.Upon reflection, happiness was experienced in part due to the perception of safety.  This may in part be due to the relaxed nature of tourists and locals alike.  It may also be in part due to the inability to understand the language.   While that may seem a bit strange, there was a comfort in not needing (consciously, subconsciously or otherwise)  to process or interpret signs, billboards, advertising or even the conversations taking place around me as they were all in Spanish and the ability to comprehend or the desire to understand was limited only to those that were necessary.","3m","45","USA","m","at_least_one_hour","single","y"
21841,"For purposes of this HIT, the specific moment is:    I spent an afternoon taking photos and catching up with a relative while on vacation in Jamaica.  (Additional details below)In late may, early June I reconnected with immediate and extended family for a reunion in Jamaica.  While the entirety of the trip was enjoyable, one moment spending a few hours with a cousin from Zimbabwe whilst on holiday in Jamaica created an atmosphere evoking happiness.  She and I spent and afternoon talking about philosophical aspects of this existence while taking photos around the resort in which we were staying.  It was enjoyable for a number of reasons.  The first was the ability to speak honestly and truthfully without fear of judgement.  The weather on this Jamaica evening was perfect - warm but pleasant.  I appreciated seeing the things she was compelled to take photos of and hearing her rationale.   It was also enjoyable to create an activity that engaged the mind to consider what it was seeing.  As we walked through the resort, we talked with two people.  One who said something alone the lines of 'You're my brother and sister' when I expressed hesitation about taking photos of her wares (which she was selling without compensation).  The other man we spoke with was on top of a lookout tour underneath which there were a whole bunch of recyclable bottles.  Turned out there was a friendly competition among staff to collect and recycle as much as possible.  The combination of reconnecting, perhaps growing closer to a distant cousin, coupled with beautiful weather, a full stomach, a sense of safety, the sounds and sights of the ocean and an engaging art project without expectation and nice staff made for a true moment of happiness.","3m","45","USA","m","half_a_day","single","y"

Beautiful scenery that was almost entirely of nature (a river, mountains, trees and grasses), the sounds of birds, good conversation, the sensations of wind on the skin and very little in terms of words or man made symbols to interpret.  While almost all aspects were enjoyable, walking through the woods shoe and clothing free while picking and eating berries was particularly enjoyable, stress free and happiness invoking.","3m","45","USA","m","half_a_day","single","y"
