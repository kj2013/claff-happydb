Here are the instructions used for collecting the moments on Amazon Mechanical Turk. HITs were randomized so that the <time period> was either “the past 24 hours” or “the past 3 months”.

------------------

What made you happy? Reflect on <time period>, and recall three actual events that happened to you that made you happy. Describe your happy moments with a complete sentence. Write three such moments. You will be also asked to note for how long each event made you happy. This task also has post-task questions. Please be sure to answer the questions.



Examples of happy moments we are NOT looking for (e.g. events in distant past, partial sentence): 

The day I married my spouse
My dog
